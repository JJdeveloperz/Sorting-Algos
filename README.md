# Sorting-Algos
Graphical Visualisation of various Sorting Algorithms Using C++.
Video ==>> https://youtu.be/FWVSPk2_oL8 .

Video is flickering because graphics are changing so rapidly and to remove flickering use delay( value )  function but it will slow down the process.
It is sorting using following algorithms.
1) Bubble Sort
2) Merge Sort
3) Quick Sort
4) Selection Sort
5) Insertion Sort
6) Heap Sort

By default it is sorting 400 numbers.
For more numbers goto step 3 and 4 below.


Steps to make it work:-

1) Load this file in TURBO C++
2) Check Path of BGI.
3) Select tot which is the number of elements to sort.
4) In draw() ,set values of line such that they get fit into the window.



For generating array of numbers , use python code written in python.txt.
